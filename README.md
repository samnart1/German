# German: A Journey to Learn the Language

Welcome to my personal journey of learning German. This repository is designed to help me (and anyone, really!) who want to start learning the German language in a structured way. I will begin with the basics, like alphabets and numbers, and gradually move towards more complex topics, such as grammar, verbs and useful sentences.

## Purpose of this Repository

- Track my progress as I learn German.
- Share my learning structure with others who might be interested.
- Provide easily digestible lessons and resources in a GitHub-friendly format.
- Focus on practical language aspects that will help anyone communicate and understand simple phrases quickly.

## Learning Roadmap
I will follow a simple progression, starting from the basics and moving towards more complex language skills:

1. **Alphabets** (including special characters in German)
2. **Numbers** (how to count in German)
3. **Pronouns** (like "I", "you", "he", "she", etc)

Each of these lessons will be structured as a separate directory with Markdown files that contain examples, exercises and notes.

## How to Use This Repository

You can follow along lesson by lesson, or jump to sections you're interested in. Each lesson is written in Markdown, so you can easily read it in GitHub or clone the repo for offline learning.

### Example Workflow:

- Clone this repository to your machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/samnart1/German.git
  ```
- Navigate to a lesson directory, for example:
  ```bash
  cd German/alphabets
  ```
- Open the lesson1.md file and follow along with the first lesson.
